# Data-mining
Some algorithms to form frequent itemsets/association rules from datasets, where many techniques, such as FP-tree, Apriori, PSO, GA, Granular computing, Central limit theorem and so on, are applied
# For Python 2.7
## Usage
Any `.pyd` and can be put in the working directory and be imported by Python, which is implemented by c++. The details of usage can be found in `PythonExample.py`.
## Algorithms
1. FP-Growth: `pyfpgrowth.pyd` is the corresponding `.pyd`.
2. BPSO-HD: A BPSO based algorithm mining long frequent patterns. `pybpsohd.pyd` is the corresponding `.pyd`.
3. CLT: A Central Limit Theorem based algorithm mining frequent patterns. `pyclt.pyd` is the corresponding `.pyd`.
