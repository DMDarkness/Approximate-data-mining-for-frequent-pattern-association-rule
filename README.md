# Data-mining
Some algorithms to form frequent itemsets/association rules from datasets, where many techniques, such as FP-tree, Apriori, PSO, GA, Granular computing, Central limit theorem and so on, are applied
# Usage
Every single `.cpp` can be compiled to an `.exe` file. The details can be found in Document.
# Algorithms
1. FP-Growth: `fpgrowth.cpp` is an implementation.
2. Apriori: `figf.cpp`(parameter Apri>0) is an implementation.
2. BPSO-HD: `bpsohd.cpp` is an implementation, which is a BPSO based algorithm mining long frequent patterns.
3. ARMGA: `armga.cpp` is an implementation, which is a GA based association rules mining algorithm.
4. FI-GF: `figf.cpp`(parameter Apri<=0) is an implementation, which is a GrC and fuzzy theory based algorithm mining frequent patterns.
5. CLT: `clt.cpp` is an implementation, which is a Central Limit Theorem based algorithm mining frequent patterns.
