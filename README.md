# Data-mining
Some algorithms to form frequent itemsets/association rules from datasets, where many techniques, such as FP-tree, Apriori, PSO, GA, Granular computing, Central limit theorem and so on, are applied
# C++ code for exe file
## Usage
Every `.cpp` can be compiled to the `.exe` file, and the details of usage can be found in `Document of c++ for exe.md`.
## Algorithms
1. FP-Growth: A common used algorithm mining frequent patterns.
2. BPSO-HD: A BPSO (Binary Particle Swarm Optimization) based algorithm mining long frequent patterns.
3. CLT: A Central Limit Theorem based algorithm mining frequent patterns.
4. ARMGA: A GA (Genetic Algorithm) based algorithm mining association rules.
5. FI-GF: A GrC (Granular Computing) based algorithm mining frequent patterns.
6. Apriori: A common used algorithm mining frequent patterns.
# For Python 2.7
## Usage
Any `.pyd` can be put in the working directory and be imported by Python, which is also implemented by c++. The details of usage can be found in `Document of pyd.py`.
## Algorithms
1. FP-Growth: `pyfpgrowth.pyd` is the corresponding `.pyd`.
2. BPSO-HD: A BPSO (Binary Particle Swarm Optimization) based algorithm mining long frequent patterns. `pybpsohd.pyd` is the corresponding `.pyd`.
3. CLT: A Central Limit Theorem based algorithm mining frequent patterns. `pyclt.pyd` is the corresponding `.pyd`.
4. ARMGA: A GA (Genetic Algorithm) based algorithm mining association rules. `pyarmga.pyd` is the corresponding `.pyd`.
